- 🔐 Build **secure and resilient integrations** with OAuth2, SAML, and API Gateways.  
- ⚙️ Develop **REST & SOAP APIs** for ERP, POS, and e-commerce ecosystems (SII Chile, PrestaShop, Shopify, Mercado Libre).  
- ☁️ Deploy and automate services using **Jenkins, AWS, GCP, and Linux environments**.  
- 📊 Improve **observability and performance** with ElasticSearch, Logstash, and PostgreSQL.  
- 💡 Lead initiatives focused on **scalability, performance, and innovation** across distributed systems.
